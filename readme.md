# White House Salary Server
This is a basic example of a NodeJS service written in an ES6 style.
It provides endpoints that return all of the salary data, creates a 
new record, updates existing ones, gets a specific salary object and 
deletes a salary record from the set.

## Running the project locally
Clone the project down and install all of the dependencies by running
`npm install`.  Then you can start the server locally by running 
`npm start`.  The project will start up running on port 3000 by default.
